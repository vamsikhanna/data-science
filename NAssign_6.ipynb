    "Vanilla autoencoders, also known as autoencoders or undercomplete autoencoders, are a type of neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They belong to the broader family of autoencoder models, which are neural networks designed to learn efficient representations of data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional space and then decoding it back to its original form. Vanilla autoencoders consist of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how vanilla autoencoders work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder:** The encoder is the first part of the autoencoder. It takes the input data, typically a high-dimensional vector, and maps it to a lower-dimensional representation. This mapping is performed through a series of hidden layers in the encoder. The output of the encoder is called the \"encoded\" or \"latent\" representation, and it captures the most important features or patterns present in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decoder:** The decoder is the second part of the autoencoder. It takes the encoded representation from the encoder and attempts to reconstruct the original input data. Like the encoder, the decoder consists of a series of hidden layers. The output of the decoder should ideally match the input data as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Objective:** The primary objective during training is to minimize the reconstruction error, which is typically measured using a loss function like mean squared error (MSE) or binary cross-entropy, depending on the nature of the data (continuous or binary). The model learns to minimize this error by adjusting the weights and biases of both the encoder and the decoder through backpropagation and gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction:** One of the key applications of autoencoders, including vanilla autoencoders, is dimensionality reduction. By forcing the encoder to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the input data, autoencoders can effectively reduce the dimensionality of complex data while preserving important information. This is particularly useful for tasks like feature extraction and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection:** Autoencoders can also be used for anomaly detection. During training, the model learns to reconstruct normal data accurately. When presented with anomalous data during inference, the reconstruction error tends to be higher, indicating a potential anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Variations:** Vanilla autoencoders can be extended and modified in various ways to suit different tasks and data types. Variations include denoising autoencoders (trained to remove noise from data during reconstruction), sparse autoencoders (introducing sparsity constraints on the encoded representations), and convolutional autoencoders (designed for image data).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while vanilla autoencoders are effective for dimensionality reduction and unsupervised representation learning, they may not perform as well as more advanced architectures like variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs) for tasks like data generation and semantic interpolation. These advanced models introduce probabilistic and generative components to autoencoders, enabling them to model more complex distributions and generate new data samples."

    "Sparse autoencoders are a variant of autoencoders designed to learn sparse representations of data. In a standard autoencoder, the goal is to learn an efficient representation of the input data in the form of hidden features. However, these representations are often distributed and dense, meaning many of the features have non-zero values. Sparse autoencoders, on the other hand, aim to induce sparsity in the learned representations, meaning that most of the feature values are close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how sparse autoencoders work and why they are useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder and Decoder:** Like standard autoencoders, sparse autoencoders consist of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original data from this representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sparsity Constraints:** What sets sparse autoencoders apart are the additional sparsity constraints imposed during training. These constraints encourage the learned representations to be sparse, meaning that only a small subset of the features should be active (non-zero) for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparsity Regularization Term:** To enforce sparsity, a regularization term is added to the loss function during training. This term encourages the activation of as few neurons (features) as possible in the hidden layer of the encoder. The most common regularization term used is the L1 penalty, which penalizes large absolute values of the neuron activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Sparsity:**\n",
    "   - **Reduced Overfitting:** Sparse representations often generalize better and are less prone to overfitting because they capture the most important and discriminative features of the data.\n",
    "   - **Interpretability:** Sparse representations are more interpretable, as each active feature can be associated with a meaningful aspect of the input data.\n",
    "   - **Efficiency:** In applications where memory or computational resources are limited, sparse representations are more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Applications:** Sparse autoencoders have been used in various machine learning tasks, including feature learning, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. They are particularly useful when the input data has a high dimensionality, and you want to learn a compact and informative representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Variations:** There are variations of sparse autoencoders, such as contractive autoencoders, which add a penalty term that encourages the Jacobian matrix of the encoder's activations to be small. This has a similar effect of encouraging sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Training:** Training a sparse autoencoder involves finding the optimal weights and biases for both the encoder and decoder, while also minimizing the sparsity regularization term in the loss function. This is typically done using backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, sparse autoencoders are a valuable tool for learning compact and informative representations of high-dimensional data while promoting sparsity, which can lead to improved generalization and interpretability. They have been used in a wide range of applications, including image compression, denoising, and feature selection."

    "   - **Hierarchical Features:** Convolutional layers capture hierarchical features in the input data, making them particularly effective for image-related tasks.\n",
    "   - **Translation Invariance:** Convolutional layers are translation-invariant, meaning they can recognize patterns regardless of their location in the input. This is useful for tasks like object recognition.\n",

These deep architectures are used for feature learning, dimensionality reduction, and representation learning. Stacking autoencoders allows them to capture increasingly abstract and hierarchical features from the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how stacked autoencoders work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layered Architecture:** A stacked autoencoder typically consists of multiple autoencoders stacked in a feedforward manner. Each autoencoder is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder aims to reconstruct the original data from this representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Hierarchy:** The layers in a stacked autoencoder form a hierarchy of features. The first autoencoder in the stack learns to capture low-level features in the input data, while subsequent autoencoders learn higher-level features built upon the features learned by the previous layers. This hierarchical feature learning can be thought of as a form of unsupervised deep learning.\n",

    "3. **Training:** Stacked autoencoders are typically pretrained in a layer-wise manner.

    "Generating sentences using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) autoencoders involves training a sequence-to-sequence model that includes an LSTM-based encoder and decoder. The encoder maps input sentences into a fixed-length latent space, and the decoder generates sentences from this latent representation. This process is typically used for tasks like text generation, language modeling, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide to generating sentences using LSTM autoencoders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Prepare a dataset of sentences that you want to use for training.\n",
    "   - Tokenize the sentences into words or subword units and create a vocabulary. Each word becomes an integer index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequence Padding:**\n",
    "   - Ensure that all sentences have the same length by padding them with a special padding token if necessary. LSTM models require fixed-length sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Encoder-Decoder Model:**\n",
    "   - Build a sequence-to-sequence model with an LSTM-based encoder and decoder. The encoder processes input sentences and maps them to a fixed-length latent space representation.\n",
    "   - The decoder takes the latent representation and generates output sentences word by word.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Word Embeddings:**\n",
    "   - Use pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or train them jointly with the encoder-decoder model. Word embeddings map words to dense vector representations.\n",
    "   - Initialize the embedding layer in the encoder and decoder with the pre-trained embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training:**\n",
    "   - Train the LSTM autoencoder on your sentence dataset. The loss function should encourage the decoder to generate sentences that closely match the input sentences.\n",
    "   - Use teacher forcing during training, where the decoder is provided with the ground-truth words from the target sentence at each time step, rather than its own generated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inference:**\n",
    "   - To generate sentences, you'll need to perform inference with the trained model.\n",
    "   - Start by encoding an input sentence using the encoder. This produces a fixed-length latent representation.\n",
    "   - Initialize the decoder with the latent representation and an initial token (e.g., \"<start>\") to indicate the start of generation.\n",
    "   - Generate words one at a time using the decoder. At each step, the decoder predicts the next word based on the current word and the hidden state from the previous step.\n",
    "   - Continue generating words until you reach a special end token (e.g., \"<end>\") or a predefined maximum sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sampling Strategy:**\n",
    "   - You can use different strategies for sampling words at each step during inference. Common methods include:\n",
    "     - Greedy decoding: Select the word with the highest predicted probability at each step. This tends to produce conservative, deterministic outputs.\n",
    "     - Beam search: Maintain a list of the top-k most likely sequences and continue generating from them, selecting the sequences with the highest overall probabilities. Beam search explores multiple possibilities and can lead to more diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Temperature Parameter:**\n",
    "   - You can control the randomness of the generated sentences by introducing a temperature parameter when sampling from the predicted word probabilities. A higher temperature value (e.g., > 1) increases randomness, while a lower value (e.g., < 1) makes the generation more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Post-Processing:**\n",
    "   - After generating a sentence, you can post-process it by reversing the tokenization and turning it back into human-readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the generated sentences for quality using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or human evaluation, depending on the specific task and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM autoencoders are versatile and can be adapted for various natural language generation tasks, including text completion, summarization, and dialogue generation. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve the quality and diversity of generated sentences."

    "Extractive summarization is a text summarization technique that involves selecting and extracting the most important sentences or passages from a longer document to create a concise summary. Unlike abstractive summarization, which generates summaries in a more creative and human-like manner by rewriting sentences and possibly introducing new words, extractive summarization relies on directly extracting existing sentences from the source document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how extractive summarization works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Document:** The process begins with a source document, which can be a news article, research paper, blog post, or any other text containing valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing:** The source document is preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. Common preprocessing steps include tokenization (splitting text into words or sentences), removing stopwords (common words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\"), and stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sentence Scoring:** Extractive summarization relies on a scoring mechanism to determine the importance of each sentence in the source document. Several methods can be used for sentence scoring, including:\n",
    "   - **Frequency-Based Methods:** Sentences containing frequently occurring words or phrases are considered important.\n",
    "   - **Position-Based Methods:** The position of a sentence in the document can be a factor. For example, the beginning and end sentences of a document might be more important.\n",
    "   - **Length-Based Methods:** Longer sentences may be considered more informative.\n",
    "   - **Centrality Measures:** Algorithms like PageRank can be adapted to identify central sentences in the document.\n",
    "   - **Machine Learning Models:** Supervised or unsupervised machine learning models can be trained to predict sentence importance based on features such as term frequency, document structure, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sentence Selection:** Once sentences are scored, a threshold or selection criterion is applied to determine which sentences will be included in the summary. Sentences that meet or exceed the threshold are selected for extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summary Generation:** The selected sentences are combined to form the extractive summary. These sentences are typically presented in the same order as they appear in the source document.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Post-Processing:** The extractive summary may undergo post-processing to ensure coherence and readability. This can involve minor adjustments to sentence transitions and the addition of transitional phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Output:** The final output is the extractive summary, which provides a condensed version of the source document while retaining the key information and the original document's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of extractive summarization:\n",
    "- Simplicity: Extractive summarization is relatively straightforward compared to abstractive summarization.\n",
    "- Content Preservation: Since extractive summarization selects sentences directly from the source, it ensures that important details and nuances are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges of extractive summarization:\n",
    "- Redundancy: Extracted sentences may contain redundant information, leading to repetitive summaries.\n",
    "- Lack of Creativity: Extractive summarization does not generate novel sentences, limiting its ability to provide a fresh perspective.\n",
    "- Informativeness: Extracted sentences may not always capture the essence of the document, leading to summaries that miss the broader context or main points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization is commonly used in various applications, such as news article summarization, document summarization, and content extraction for search engines. It serves as a valuable tool for quickly obtaining the most essential information from lengthy texts."

    "6. **Quality Evaluation:** The quality of the generated summary is typically evaluated using metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy).

    "Beam search is a search algorithm used in various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks, including machine translation, text generation, and speech recognition. It is commonly employed in sequence-to-sequence models, such as neural machine translation models and abstractive text summarization models, to generate sequences of words or tokens. Beam search is used to find the most likely sequence of outputs given a sequence of inputs, while considering multiple alternative sequences in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how beam search works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Beam search starts with an initial sequence, often consisting of just a start token (e.g., \"<start>\"). This initial sequence represents the beginning of the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expanding Sequences:** At each step of sequence generation, the algorithm considers multiple alternatives. It does this by extending each candidate sequence with one additional token to create several new sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scoring Sequences:** For each extended sequence, a scoring function is applied to evaluate how likely it is to be a good continuation of the previous sequence. The scoring function is typically based on a language model or another relevant criterion. It assigns a score to each extended sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selecting Top Candidates:** The algorithm selects the top-k extended sequences with the highest scores, where k is a hyperparameter known as the \"beam width.\" These top-k candidates represent the most promising sequences at the current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pruning:** To manage computational complexity and reduce redundancy, beam search often prunes or limits the number of sequences it considers. It keeps only the top-k candidates and discards the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat:** Steps 2 to 5 are repeated for each step of sequence generation until a stopping condition is met. This condition could be reaching a maximum sequence length, generating an end token (e.g., \"<end>\"), or finding the desired number of output sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Output:** The output of beam search is the sequence or sequences with the highest cumulative scores based on the scoring function. These sequences represent the most likely and coherent outputs given the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of beam search:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diverse Outputs:** Beam search can produce diverse output sequences by considering multiple alternatives in parallel, which can be useful for avoiding repetitive or overly similar generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** The choice of the beam width (k) is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. A larger k explores more possibilities but increases computational complexity, while a smaller k may lead to more focused but potentially less diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greedy Search:** When the beam width is set to 1 (k=1), beam search becomes equivalent to greedy search, where only the top-scoring sequence is chosen at each step. Greedy search tends to produce deterministic outputs but may lack diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature Parameter:** In some implementations of beam search, a temperature parameter can be used to control the randomness of sequence selection. A higher temperature increases randomness, while a lower temperature makes the selection more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is a versatile algorithm used in various applications to improve the quality and diversity of generated sequences, making it a valuable tool for tasks involving sequence generation in natural language processing and beyond."

    "Length normalization, also known as length penalty or length normalization penalty, is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation and text generation, to address the issue of sentence or sequence length bias during decoding. It adjusts the scores or probabilities of sequences based on their lengths to encourage the generation of sequences of more appropriate lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation for length normalization is that without it, generative models, especially those based on sequence-to-sequence architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, may favor shorter sequences over longer ones. This bias can lead to the generation of overly concise or incomplete output, as shorter sequences often have higher likelihoods due to their fewer tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how length normalization works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequence Scoring:** During sequence generation, each candidate sequence is assigned a score or probability based on the likelihood of generating that sequence given the input and the model's parameters. This score is typically computed using a language model or other relevant criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Length Calculation:** The length of each candidate sequence is determined by counting the number of tokens or characters it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization Factor:** A length normalization factor or penalty is introduced into the scoring process. This factor is a function of the sequence length and is designed to encourage sequences of moderate or appropriate lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjusting Scores:** The length normalization factor is applied to the score or probability of each candidate sequence. The adjustment is typically multiplicative, meaning it scales the score by the factor. The adjusted score reflects not only the likelihood but also the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Selection:** The candidate sequence with the highest adjusted score, which balances both likelihood and length, is selected as the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to implementing length normalization, and the specific form of the length normalization factor can vary. Some common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length Penalty Factor:** A length penalty factor is introduced into the scoring formula. For example, a factor like α (typically less than 1) can be multiplied by the log-likelihood score, where α < 1 penalizes longer sequences. The length-normalized score becomes: `Score_normalized = Score_original / (length^α)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Length Penalty:** An exponential length penalty factor can be used, which is similar to the length penalty factor but uses an exponential function. The length-normalized score becomes: `Score_normalized = Score_original / exp(α * length)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Forms:** More complex functions, such as polynomial or logarithmic penalties, can be used to adjust scores based on sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of length normalization method and the value of the length penalty hyperparameter (e.g., α) depend on the specific NLP task and the desired trade-off between likelihood and length. Longer sequences may require a smaller penalty to encourage diversity, while shorter sequences may benefit from a larger penalty to promote completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length normalization is a crucial technique in NLP tasks to ensure that generated sequences are of appropriate lengths, strike a balance between likelihood and length, and avoid generating overly short or long output."

    "Coverage normalization is a technique used in sequence-to-sequence models, particularly in tasks like machine translation and abstractive text summarization, to address the problem of repeating or omitting words and phrases during the generation of target sequences. It helps to improve the quality and fluency of generated sequences by encouraging the model to attend to parts of the source sequence that have not been attended to sufficiently. Coverage normalization is often used in conjunction with attention mechanisms like the Bahdanau or Luong attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how coverage normalization works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention Mechanism:** Sequence-to-sequence models use an attention mechanism to determine which parts of the input (source sequence) are most relevant when generating each word in the output (target sequence). The attention mechanism computes attention scores for each input token at each decoding step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coverage Vector:** In addition to the standard attention mechanism, coverage normalization introduces a coverage vector. This vector keeps track of how much attention has been paid to each source token over the course of decoding. Initially, the coverage vector is initialized to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attention Scores Modification:** At each decoding step, the attention scores computed by the standard attention mechanism are modified by adding a term based on the coverage vector. This modification encourages the model to focus on source tokens that have not received sufficient attention in previous decoding steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Coverage Update:** After modifying the attention scores, the coverage vector is updated by adding the attention scores to the previous coverage vector. This update accumulates attention over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Length Normalization:** To avoid overly emphasizing longer source sequences, the coverage vector can be length-normalized. This means dividing the coverage vector by the length of the source sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Decoding:** The modified attention scores, adjusted for coverage, are used to generate the next word in the target sequence. This process repeats until the entire target sequence is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind coverage normalization is to reduce repetition and improve fluency in the generated output. By encouraging the model to attend to underrepresented parts of the source sequence, coverage normalization helps prevent the omission of important information from the source and reduces the likelihood of repeating words or phrases in the target sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coverage normalization is particularly useful in abstractive summarization tasks, where the goal is to generate concise and coherent summaries of longer documents. It has also been applied in machine translation to improve translation quality, especially when translating between languages with different word orders or structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, coverage normalization is an important technique in sequence-to-sequence modeling that helps address issues related to attention and repetition, leading to more fluent and accurate generated sequences."

    "ROUGE, which stands for \"Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation,\" is a set of metrics used for the automatic evaluation of the quality of machine-generated text, particularly in tasks like text summarization and machine translation. ROUGE metrics measure the similarity between the generated text and one or more reference texts (also known as human-generated or gold-standard text) to assess the quality of the generated content. ROUGE metrics are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) research and text generation evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key ROUGE metrics and their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ROUGE-N (n-gram overlap):** ROUGE-N measures the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words) between the generated text and the reference text. The most common values for n are 1 (unigrams), 2 (bigrams), and 3 (trigrams).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap): Measures the overlap of individual words between the generated and reference text.\n",
    "   - ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap): Measures the overlap of two-word sequences (bigrams) between the generated and reference text.\n",
    "   - ROUGE-3 (trigram overlap): Measures the overlap of three-word sequences (trigrams) between the generated and reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence):** ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference text. The LCS is the longest sequence of words that appears in both the generated and reference texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROUGE-W (weighted LCS):** ROUGE-W is an extension of ROUGE-L that assigns more weight to longer LCSs, giving credit to longer matching sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROUGE-S (skip-bigram overlap):** ROUGE-S measures the overlap of skip-bigrams between the generated and reference text. Skip-bigrams are pairs of words with a certain maximum number of words in between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ROUGE-SU (skip-bigram unigram overlap):** ROUGE-SU is an extension of ROUGE-S that combines skip-bigrams and unigrams in the overlap calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ROUGE-P (precision):** ROUGE-P measures the precision of the generated text compared to the reference text. It assesses how many of the generated n-grams are also present in the reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ROUGE-R (recall):** ROUGE-R measures the recall of the generated text compared to the reference text. It assesses how many of the reference n-grams are also present in the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ROUGE-F1 (F1 score):** ROUGE-F1 is the harmonic mean of precision (ROUGE-P) and recall (ROUGE-R). It provides a balanced measure of the quality of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE metrics are typically computed at different n-gram levels (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) and then aggregated to provide an overall evaluation of the generated text. The choice of which ROUGE metrics to use depends on the specific task and the aspects of quality you want to evaluate. ROUGE scores are often reported as ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-F1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher ROUGE scores indicate a higher degree of similarity between the generated text and the reference text, implying better quality. These metrics are valuable for comparing and evaluating different text generation systems and techniques objectively."
