    "The distinction between greedy and non-greedy matching makes a difference when you have patterns that can match multiple portions of a string. Here's when it matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching:**\n",
    "   - **Greedy:** Matches as much as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.\n",
    "   - **Non-Greedy (Lazy):** Matches as little as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When it Matters:**\n",
    "   - In situations where the input string contains multiple instances of the pattern you're trying to match, greedy matching will try to match the longest possible substring that meets the pattern's criteria, while non-greedy matching will try to match the shortest possible substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:**\n",
    "   - Suppose you have the string `\"abc123def456\"` and you want to extract all numeric substrings.\n",
    "   - Using a greedy pattern like `.*\\d+`, it would match the entire string `\"abc123def456\"`, which is the longest possible match.\n",
    "   - Using a non-greedy pattern like `.*?\\d+`, it would match `\"abc123\"` first and then `\"def456\"`, which are the shortest possible matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unavailable Non-Greedy:**\n",
    "   - If you need a non-greedy match, but only a greedy pattern is available, you can try to modify the pattern to make it non-greedy by adding a `?` after `*` or `+`.\n",
    "   - If the pattern is inherently greedy and cannot be changed (e.g., due to the nature of the regex itself), you may need to extract the matches and then manually trim or process them to achieve the desired non-greedy behavior in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, greedy vs. non-greedy matching makes a difference when dealing with multiple potential matches in a string. If a non-greedy pattern is not available, you can often modify a greedy pattern by adding a `?` to make it non-greedy. However, some patterns may inherently be greedy, requiring additional post-processing to achieve non-greedy behavior."

    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tagged Group `(...)`:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Tagged Group `(?:...)`:**\n",
    "   - A non-tagged group is a non-capturing group, and it does not capture the text that matches the enclosed pattern.\n",
    "   - It is used for grouping patterns without the intention of capturing the text for later use.\n",
    "   - Example: `(?:abc)` does not capture \"abc\"; it only groups the pattern for matching purposes.\n",

    "However, using non-tagged groups can be useful for improving the performance of the regular expression, as they don't incur the overhead of capturing and storing the matched text. If performance is a concern, using non-tagged groups for patterns that don't need capturing can be a good practice."

    "In summary, the `Scanner` interface is beneficial when you need to perform sequential parsing of a string, maintain context, and implement custom parsing logic. It is particularly useful for parsing structured data or languages. On the other hand, `re.findall()` is suitable for simple pattern matching tasks that involve searching for and extracting non-overlapping occurrences of a pattern in a string. The choice between the two depends on the specific parsing requirements of your task."

    "No, a `Scanner` object does not have to be named \"scanner.\" The name you choose for a `Scanner` object, or any object in Python, is entirely up to you and should reflect the variable's purpose and context in your code. In Python, variable names are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must follow some naming conventions:\n",

    "1. Variable names should be descriptive: Choose a name that indicates the purpose or content of the object.\n",
