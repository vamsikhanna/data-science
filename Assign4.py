# # Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?
# 
# 

# To support iteration, you can use the __iter__ and __next__ methods in your class.
# 
# The __iter__ method should return an iterator object, and the __next__ method should return the next value in the sequence. You can use the StopIteration exception to signal the end of the iteration.

# # Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?
# 
# 

# The __str__ method is used to define the string representation of an object, and is called when the object is printed using the print() function or when it is converted to a string using the str() function.
# 
# The __repr__ method is used to define a representation of an object that can be used to recreate the object. It is called when the object is printed using the print() function or when it is included in a string that is being used for debugging or logging.

# # Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?
# 
# 

# To intercept slice operations in a class, you can define the __getitem__ and __setitem__ methods. These methods allow you to define how the class should behave when it is indexed or sliced.
# 

# # Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?

# To capture in-place addition in a class, you can define the __iadd__ method. This method is called when the += operator is used with an instance of the class on the left-hand side of the operator.

# # Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?

# Operator overloading is a feature in some programming languages that allows operators (such as + or -) to have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. In general, it is appropriate to use operator overloading when you want to define a more natural or intuitive interface for a class or type that you are creating.
# 
# There are a few specific cases where operator overloading is commonly used:
# 
# When you want to define how two objects of a class should be added together or compared to each other using the + or == operators.
# 
# When you want to define how an object of a class should be converted to a primitive type, such as an integer or string, using the (int) or (string) operators.
# 
# When you want to define how an object of a class should be used in a mathematical expression, such as with the * or / operators.
